    \chapter{Effort spent}\label{ch:effort-spent}
    The major part of the document has been produced working together and thatâ€™s the reason why there is not a precise division of hours per sections and per group component.
    The following is an approximate estimation of the number of hours of work for each group member:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Federico Innocente: 3 days;
        \item Federico Morreale: 2 days;
        \item Evandro Maddes: 2 days.
    \end{itemize}
