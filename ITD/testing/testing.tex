    \chapter{Testing}\label{ch:testing}
    The testing has been done mostly as written in the DD. We perform two different types of tests to validate the behaviour of the complete system: front-end and back-end.
    \newline For more information we suggest to see the \href{https://github.com/fedy97/MorrealeMaddesInnocente/tree/master/safe_streets/test}{\emph{source code of the tests}}
    \section{Unit testing}\label{sec:unit-testing}
    The purpose of a unit test is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
    We tests the building of the statistics, the violation query and the violation visualization.
    \newline Every test is formed by three section:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item setup: in this section there is the setup and the instantiation of the elements useful during the test.
        \item run: the core section where functions are called.
        \item verify: throw the command \textit{expect()} there is the comparison between the results and the expected one.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Build statistics}\label{subsec:build-statistics}
    We tests all the three types of and for each type we build different test cases to validate different situation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item effectiveness:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item One report uploaded and not fined;
            \item One report uploaded and fined;
            \item Two reports uploaded: one fined and one not;
        \end{enumerate}
        \item daily reports:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Zero violation uploaded today;
            \item One violation uploaded today;
            \item one violation uploaded today and one yesterday;
        \end{enumerate}
        \item most committed violation:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Zero violation uploaded, no most committed violation;
            \item One violation uploaded is the most committed;
            \item Three violations uploaded of the same type are the most committed;
            \item Two violations uploaded of the same type and one of another type, the two ones are the most committed;
        \end{enumerate}
        All tests have the expected behaviour so performs as designed.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Violation query}\label{subsec:violation-query}
    To make a violation query a generic user of the app must set different parameters: city, type of violation and the period in which it wants to retrive the information (from date, to date).
    To analyze the behavior of violation query manager, we build a test case for each combination of the previous parameters.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item One report respects all the bounds of the query;
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on violation);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on timeFrom);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on timeFrom and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on violation and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on violation and timeFrom);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on violation and timeFrom and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and timeFrom);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and timeFrom and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and violation);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and violation and timeTo);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and violation and timeFrom);
        \item Two report respects the bounds of the query(no bounds on city and violation and timeFrom and timeTo);
    \end{enumerate}
    All tests have the expected behaviour so performs as designed.

    \subsection{Violation visualization}\label{subsec:violation-visualization}
    We tested the interaction between the reports stored and the reports presented on the map; in particular we tested the bound on the visualization of the reports of the last 24 hours (today).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No violation uploaded;
        \item Two violation not fined today;
        \item Two report not fined yesterday;
        \item Report uploaded yesterday;
        \item Two reports,only one today;
        \item Two report on same position;
    \end{enumerate}
    All tests set the expected number of reports in the correct position.
    \section{Widget testing}\label{sec:widget-testing}
    A widget test validate a single widget.
    The goal of a widget test is to verify that the widgetâ€™s UI looks and interacts as expected so they can actually test the UI.
